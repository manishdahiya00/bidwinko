    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>Welcome to BidWinko! Our bidding app provides a unique and exciting way to participate in auctions. Hereâ€™s a
      step-by-step guide on how to use our platform:</p>

    <h4 class="section-title">1. Place Your Bid</h4>
    <p>Choose your bid amount within the specified range. Bids can be placed in increments from .00 to .99 within each
      range. For example, if the range is 10 to 20, you can place bids like 10.01, 10.25, or 19.99.</p>

    <h4 class="section-title">2. Bidding Ranges</h4>
    <p>Bidding ranges are set from 0 to 100. Each range has multiple possible bid amounts within it. Make sure to select
      a bid that you think is the lowest possible within the range to increase your chances of winning.</p>

    <h4 class="section-title">3. Bid Completion</h4>
    <p>Once the bidding period ends, the offer is completed. All bids are then reviewed to determine the winner. The
      winner is selected based on the lowest bid amount within the range. However, if multiple users have placed the
      same lowest bid, only one of those bids will be considered, and others will be canceled.</p>

    <h4 class="section-title">4. Results Announcement</h4>
    <p>After determining the winner, the results are announced. You will be able to see the winning bid amount and the
      lowest bid in the range. If your bid was the lowest and unique, you will be notified as the winner!</p>

    <h4 class="section-title">5. Understanding Bid Cancellation</h4>
    <p>If your bid matches the lowest bid but is not unique (i.e., other users have placed the same bid), your bid will
      be canceled. Ensure you place a unique bid to enhance your chance of winning.</p>
